## 1. Variables
Consider 2x + y = 3
The equation has variables (x and y) to hold the data/values. This means that the variables x and y are placeholders for representing data. Similarily, in computer science programming, we need something for holding data, and **variables** is the way to do that.

## 2. Data Types
In the above equation, the variables x and y can take values such as integral numbers, real numbers etc. To solve the equation, we need to relate them to the kind of of values they can take, and data type is the name used for this purpose in computer science programming. **A data type in a programming language is a set of data with predefined values.**
*e.g. integers, floating point, unit numbers, character, string etc.*

Computer memory is filled with ones and zeroes. It's very difficult to program in zeroes and ones. To solve this, programming languages and compilers provide us with data types. For example, integers take 2 bytes (actual value depeds on compiler), float take 4 bytes etc. This say that in memory we are combining 2 bytes (16 bits) and calling it an integer. Similarily, combining 4 bytes (32 bits) and calling it a float. A data type reduces the coding efforts. At the top level, there are two types of data types:<br>
(1) System defined data types (primitive data types)
(2) User defined data types
